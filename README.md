#This is the code for the HASTOC strategies described in the above mentioned paper (see link)
#Based on the  Japanese  Heiken  Ashi  (HA)  candles  we  develop  the  Heiken  Ashi  stochastic  or  HASTOC, which can reflect in a single number both the likelihood of #trend generation and momentum in the market. We back test ten strategies using HA and HASTOC for three currencies, one index and one  currency  for  three  major  time  frame  in  each  market.  We  find  the  strategies  give  consistent profits for these markets. The study contributes to economic literature as well as to practical #trading scenario by  the development of a  new indicator, HASTOC which in  a single number,  gives the trend generation and momentum in the market
